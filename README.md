Carefully read the following steps to ensure optimal functionality of the bot.


# ---------- HOW TO START THE BOT ---------- #

1. Complete the 'config.json' with the information we request.

2. Replace the assigned elements in 'index.js' to enable the bot to perform the designated function.
# Example: // Replace with the CHANNEL ID you want to assign \\ or // Replace with the ROLE ID you want to assign \\

3. Open the "start.bat". If you open the "start.bat" but it closes abruptly, it indicates that there is an error in what you have added.

# READY!
