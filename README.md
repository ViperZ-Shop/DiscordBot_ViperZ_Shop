## HOW TO START THE BOT 

1. Complete the "**config.json**" with the information we request.

2. Replace the assigned elements in "**index.js**" to enable the bot to perform the designated function.
**Example: Replace with the CHANNEL ID you want to assign**

3. Open the "**start.bat**". If you open the "**start.bat**" but it closes abruptly, it indicates that there is an error in what you have added.

## **READY!**
